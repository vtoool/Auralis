## 1. Backend Setup with Supabase

> **MANDATORY FIRST STEP:** This section is required for the application to function. The app will fail with a "table not found" or "schema cache" error if the database script in Step 2 is not run successfully in your Supabase project.

Supabase is an open-source Firebase alternative providing a PostgreSQL database, authentication, file storage, and serverless functions.

### Step 1: Create a Supabase Project

1.  Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and sign up/log in.
2.  Create a new project. Choose a strong database password and save it securely.

### Step 2: Run the Database Setup Script

Navigate to the **SQL Editor** in your Supabase dashboard. Click "+ New query" and paste the entire script below. This will create your `courses`, `appointments`, `unavailabilities`, and `contacts` tables, add sample course data, and set up a database function for rescheduling.

**CRITICAL:** After pasting the script, click **"Run"**. You must see a "Success. No rows returned" message. This script is "idempotent," meaning you can safely run it multiple times without causing errors.

```sql
-- 1. Create the 'courses' table if it doesn't exist
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.courses (
  id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  type TEXT,
  price NUMERIC,
  "imageUrl" TEXT,
  duration TEXT,
  paddle_product_id TEXT,
  file_url TEXT -- To store the link to the course video/audio file
);

-- Note: RLS is disabled by default for new tables. This command ensures it's off.
-- You should enable and configure RLS policies before going to production.
ALTER TABLE public.courses DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 2. Insert mock data to populate the courses section
-- NOTE: If you run this script multiple times, it will insert duplicate mock courses.
-- This is safe for setup but you can delete duplicates from the Supabase table editor.
INSERT INTO public.courses (title, description, type, price, "imageUrl", duration, paddle_product_id)
VALUES
  ('Foundations of Mindfulness', 'A comprehensive video series teaching the core principles of mindfulness to reduce stress and cultivate presence.', 'Video Course', 49.99, 'https://picsum.photos/400/300?random=10', '4 Hours', 'prod_12345'),
  ('Morning Gratitude Meditation', 'Begin each day with a positive and grateful mindset through this beautifully guided audio meditation.', 'Audio Meditation', 9.99, 'https://picsum.photos/400/300?random=11', '15 Mins', 'prod_12346'),
  ('Chakra Balancing for Beginners', 'An introductory video course to understanding, clearing, and balancing your seven chakras for spiritual well-being.', 'Video Course', 69.99, 'https://picsum.photos/400/300?random=12', '6 Hours', 'prod_12347'),
  ('Deep Sleep Hypnosis', 'A soothing audio journey designed to help you release the day and drift into a deep, restorative, and peaceful sleep.', 'Audio Meditation', 14.99, 'https://picsum.photos/400/300?random=13', '30 Mins', 'prod_12348');

-- 3. Create the 'appointments' table if it doesn't exist
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.appointments (
  id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  date DATE NOT NULL,
  time TEXT NOT NULL,
  service TEXT -- To store the selected service for the appointment
);

-- This ensures the 'service' column exists for new appointment features.
-- It's safe to run even if the column already exists.
ALTER TABLE public.appointments ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS service TEXT;


ALTER TABLE public.appointments DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 4. Create the 'unavailabilities' table if it doesn't exist
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.unavailabilities (
  id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
  unavailable_date DATE NOT NULL,
  start_time TIME, -- Can be null if the whole day is blocked
  end_time TIME,   -- Can be null if the whole day is blocked
  reason TEXT      -- Optional reason, e.g., "Holiday"
);

ALTER TABLE public.unavailabilities DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 5. Create the 'contacts' table (for contact form submissions) if it doesn't exist
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.contacts (
  id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  message TEXT,
  is_read BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE NOT NULL
);

ALTER TABLE public.contacts DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 6. Create the server-side function to handle rescheduling appointments atomically
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION reschedule_appointment(
    p_appointment_id BIGINT,
    p_new_date DATE,
    p_new_time TEXT
)
RETURNS void AS $$
DECLARE
    v_old_date DATE;
    v_old_time TEXT;
    v_name TEXT;
    v_new_end_time TIME;
BEGIN
    -- Step 1: Get the old appointment details to find the matching unavailability
    SELECT date, time, name
    INTO v_old_date, v_old_time, v_name
    FROM public.appointments
    WHERE id = p_appointment_id;

    -- Step 2: Delete the old unavailability block to free up the slot
    DELETE FROM public.unavailabilities
    WHERE unavailable_date = v_old_date
      AND start_time = (v_old_time || ':00')::TIME
      AND reason = (v_name || '''s appointment');

    -- Step 3: Update the appointment with the new date and time
    UPDATE public.appointments
    SET date = p_new_date,
        time = p_new_time
    WHERE id = p_appointment_id;

    -- Step 4: Create a new unavailability block for the new time
    -- Calculate end time (30 mins after start)
    v_new_end_time := (p_new_time || ':00')::TIME + interval '30 minutes';

    INSERT INTO public.unavailabilities (unavailable_date, start_time, end_time, reason)
    VALUES (p_new_date, (p_new_time || ':00')::TIME, v_new_end_time, (v_name || '''s appointment'));

END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### Step 2a: Create Storage Bucket & Policies

For the course file uploads in the admin dashboard to work, you must create a storage bucket and set its access policies.

1.  **Create the Bucket:**
    *   In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Storage** (the cylinder icon on the left).
    *   Click **"Create a new bucket"**.
    *   Name the bucket exactly `courses`.
    *   Toggle **"Public bucket"** to ON. This allows anyone with the direct URL to view the files.
    *   Click **"Create bucket"**.

2.  **Add Security Policies for Uploads:**
    *   By default, storage buckets are protected from uploads. We need to add rules (called Policies) to allow your admin user (any logged-in user) to upload files.
    *   Go back to the **SQL Editor**.
    *   Click **"+ New query"** and paste and run the following script. This script is safe to run multiple times; it will clean up old policies and apply the new, correct ones.

    > **Troubleshooting Tip:** If you see the error `Upload failed: new row violates row-level security policy`, it means this script was not run successfully. Running this script is the solution.

    ```sql
    -- This script is idempotent and can be run multiple times.
    -- It removes old policies before creating the new, more specific ones.

    -- Drop the old single policy if it exists from a previous version of this guide
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can manage course files" ON storage.objects;

    -- Drop the new policies if they exist, to ensure a clean slate on re-run
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can view course files" ON storage.objects;
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can upload course files" ON storage.objects;
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can update course files" ON storage.objects;
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can delete course files" ON storage.objects;

    -- Create new, specific policies for clarity and correctness:

    -- 1. Policy to allow authenticated users to VIEW/DOWNLOAD files.
    CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view course files"
    ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
    TO authenticated
    USING ( bucket_id = 'courses' );

    -- 2. Policy to allow authenticated users to UPLOAD files.
    -- This policy is the specific fix for the "violates row-level security" error on upload.
    CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload course files"
    ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
    TO authenticated
    WITH CHECK ( bucket_id = 'courses' );

    -- 3. Policy to allow authenticated users to UPDATE files (e.g., move/rename).
    CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can update course files"
    ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
    TO authenticated
    USING ( bucket_id = 'courses' );

    -- 4. Policy to allow authenticated users to DELETE files.
    CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can delete course files"
    ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
    TO authenticated
    USING ( bucket_id = 'courses' );
    ```
    *   Click **"Run"**. You must see a "Success. No rows returned" message. Once this is done, your file uploads will work.

### Step 3: Connect Frontend to Supabase

Your Supabase credentials are required to connect the application to the database. They are located in the `src/services/supabaseClient.ts` file.

1.  Open the file `src/services/supabaseClient.ts`.
2.  You will find your credentials already set up for you. If you ever need to change them, this is the file to edit.

    ```typescript
    // src/services/supabaseClient.ts

    const supabaseUrl = "https://qzlxlxowkwtxpdxfdrql.supabase.co";
    const supabaseAnonKey = "eyJhbGciOi...JbJ2Tk"; // Your key
    ```

> **Security Warning:** Hardcoding keys in your frontend code is convenient for initial setup but is not recommended for production. Anyone who can view your website's source code can see these keys. For deployment, you should switch to using **Environment Variables** as described by your hosting provider (e.g., Vercel, Netlify). This involves removing the hardcoded keys and loading them from a secure store, for example: `const supabaseUrl = process.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL;`

### Troubleshooting Common Errors
> **ATTENTION: READ THIS IF YOU SEE AN ERROR**
> 
> **Common Error Message:**
> > `Could not find the 'file_url' column of 'courses' in the schema cache`
> 
> This is one of the most common setup errors. It means your application is trying to access a column that doesn't exist in your database, or that your browser has an outdated "memory" of your database structure.
> 
> **Solution Steps:**
> 
> 1.  **Surgical Fix (Recommended First Step):** If you have already set up your tables and data but are specifically missing the `file_url`--- END OF FILE AGENTS.md ---

# Agent Memory & Project Guide: Spiritul Nostru Wellness Platform

This document serves as an internal memory for the AI agent working on this project. It tracks key decisions, progress, past mistakes, and self-prompting instructions to ensure consistent and high-quality development.

## Project Objective

Spiritul Nostru is a stylish and elegant spiritual wellness platform. The goal is to create a beautiful, functional, and user-friendly web application for Alice, the instructor.

**Core Features:**
-   **Public Site:** Hero section, course listings, about page, testimonials, booking calendar, contact form.
-   **Admin Dashboard:** Secure login for Alice to manage courses (including file uploads) and block out her availability for appointments.
-   **Theming & Internationalization:** Multiple color themes and language support (English, Romanian, Russian).
-   **Backend:** Supabase for database, authentication, and storage.

## Current Tasks & To-Do

-   **[PENDING USER INPUT] Integrate Official Logo:** Awaiting the user to provide the base64 encoded version of their official logo (preferably in SVG format). Once received, I will replace the current placeholder logo component (`components/Logo.tsx`) across the application (Header, Footer, etc.) to ensure brand consistency.

---

## Development Log & Key Decisions

-   **Backend:** Supabase was chosen for its integrated services (Postgres, Auth, Storage).
-   **Backend Notifications:** Consolidated all email notification logic (for new appointments and new contact messages) into a single, unified Supabase Edge Function (`send-notifications`). This function is triggered by two separate database webhooks, promoting code reuse and simplifying maintenance.
-   **Error Handling (Setup):** Initial implementation attempted to show a detailed setup guide (`SetupGuide.tsx`) in the UI if the database connection failed. This was revised based on user feedback.
-   **Current Approach (Setup):** Setup errors are now handled by displaying a simple, non-technical error message to the user, while detailed error logs and warnings pointing to `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` are shown in the developer console. This maintains a clean UX while providing necessary information to the developer.
-   **Credential Management:** Refactored from hardcoded placeholder credentials in `supabaseClient.ts` to using a standard `.env` file. This was later reverted to solve an immediate user setup issue.

---

## Mistakes & Learnings

### **Oversight:** Incomplete Database Setup Script

-   **Incident:** The user followed the `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` to set up email notifications. When creating the webhook for the `contacts` table, they were unable to find the table in the dropdown list in the Supabase dashboard.
-   **Why it was wrong:** My documentation was out of sync with the application's features. I had implemented the contact form on the frontend and the corresponding notification logic in the backend Edge Function, but I failed to include the necessary `CREATE TABLE public.contacts` statement in the main database setup script within the developer guide. This created a frustrating dead-end for the user during a critical setup step.
-   **Learning & Corrective Action:**
    -   **Rule:** A feature is not "done" until it is fully documented. When implementing any feature that requires a database schema change, the corresponding `CREATE`, `ALTER`, or `UPDATE` script **must** be added to the canonical setup guide (`DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` in this case). The documentation must always reflect the complete state required to run the application.
    -   **Correction:** I provided the user with the standalone SQL command to create the `contacts` table. I then immediately corrected the omission by updating the main database script in `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` to include the creation of the `contacts` table, ensuring future setups will be seamless.

### **Critical Mistake:** Embedding Developer Guides in the Frontend UI

-   **Incident:** I previously implemented a React component (`SetupGuide.tsx`) that would render directly in the application UI if a Supabase connection error was detected. This component contained detailed instructions, SQL scripts, and technical jargon intended for a developer.
-   **Why it was wrong:**
    1.  **Poor User Experience (UX):** Regular users encountering a backend issue would be presented with a complex, intimidating, and irrelevant guide. This breaks the user's immersion and causes confusion.
    2.  **Security/Information Leak:** Exposing backend schema details (table names, SQL commands) and setup procedures in the frontend bundle is a bad security practice. It gives potential attackers unnecessary information about the system's architecture.
    3.  **Violation of Separation of Concerns:** Developer documentation belongs in dedicated documentation files (`.md` files in the repo), not mixed with user-facing application code.
-   **Learning & Corrective Action:**
    -   **Rule:** **NEVER** display developer-focused instructions, setup guides, or raw technical error details in the public-facing UI.
    -   **Correction:** The `SetupGuide.tsx` component was removed. Error handling was refactored to show a generic, user-friendly error message (e.g., "Content could not be loaded at this time.") while logging detailed technical information and a pointer to `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` in the developer console, which is the appropriate place for it.

### **Critical Mistake:** Misidentifying User Credentials as Placeholders

-   **Incident:** The user provided their actual, valid Supabase credentials. I incorrectly identified them as the default placeholder values from the project template.
    -   **Project URL:** `https://qzlxlxowkwtxpdxfdrql.supabase.co`
    -   **Anon Key:** `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`
-   **Why it was wrong:** This led to an incorrect diagnosis of the user's problem. I assumed the issue was a connection to the wrong database, when the actual issue was an outdated schema in the correct database. This caused user frustration and wasted time.
-   **Learning & Corrective Action:**
    -   **Rule:** **TRUST THE USER.** When a user provides specific credentials or information, accept it as the source of truth. Do not assume they are using default values unless there is overwhelming evidence.
    -   **Correction:** My primary diagnosis for schema-related errors should now be: 1) The setup script has not been run or was run incorrectly. 2) The browser has a stale schema cache requiring a hard refresh. The "wrong credentials" issue is a less likely possibility if the user has actively configured the project. This memory file now serves as a permanent record of these valid credentials.

### **Deliberate Regression:** Reverting to Hardcoded Credentials

-   **Incident:** After guiding the user to fix their schema, they encountered the "Supabase URL and Anon Key are missing" error, which was introduced by my previous refactor to use `.env` files. The user was frustrated with the setup process and requested that I resolve the error directly.
-   **Action Taken:** To immediately resolve the user's issue and remove a setup obstacle, I reverted the credential loading mechanism in `src/services/supabaseClient.ts`. I removed the logic that reads from `process.env` and hardcoded the user's confirmed, valid credentials directly into the file.
-   **Justification:** While using environment variables is the industry best practice for security, the user's primary goal was to get the application running. This change satisfies the user's immediate request.
-   **Mitigation:** To compensate for this security regression, I updated the `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` to explain the change and added a prominent **Security Warning** advising the developer to switch back to environment variables for production deployment. This provides a working application now while still educating on best practices for the future.

---

## Self-Prompting for Future Tasks

-   **Prioritize the end-user experience above all.** Is what I'm building intuitive and clean for a non-technical user?
-   **Maintain a strict separation between developer-facing and user-facing content.** Documentation goes in `.md` files. UI is for the user.
-   **Think about security.** Am I exposing any internal implementation details in the frontend code that shouldn't be there?
-   **Verify user-provided information.** Do not dismiss user input as incorrect. Use it as the basis for diagnosis.
-   **Always refer back to this file** to remember past decisions and learnings before implementing new features or making changes.
